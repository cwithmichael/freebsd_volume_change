This program allows you to change the volume on FreeBSD systems using the mixer command. I did this in a couple of hours and the code is exteremely bad. I can not be held responsible if you use this program and it blows up your toaster.

Installation Instructions:

sudo make install 

.xinitrc example:
I have provided and example of my xinitrc below since this app is primarily for people running light window managers.

exec tint2 -c ~/.config/tint2/default.tint2rc &
exec mix &
exec openbox
